/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Link interface (retroXR extension; candidate upstream environment 94).
 *
 * Deliberately one contiguous block rather than following libretro.h's usual
 * split of "environment defines grouped near the top, structs further down".
 * This block is maintained identically in two headers of very different
 * vintage (mGBA's bundled copy and libretro-godot's vendored libretro-common),
 * and keeping it in one piece makes them trivial to diff.

/* struct retro_link_interface * --
 * Lets a core join a link bus hosted by the frontend, so that two or more core
 * instances running in the same process can emulate machines that were
 * originally joined by a cable: a GBA link cable, a Game Boy serial cable, a
 * GameCube-to-GBA cable, and so on.
 *
 * This exists because core instances cannot reach each other on their own. A
 * frontend that runs several cores at once generally loads each from its own
 * copy of the shared library, so each instance has its own copy of every
 * global and no in-core coordinator can be shared between them. The frontend
 * is the only thing they have in common, so the frontend hosts the bus.
 *
 * The frontend arbitrates emulated time and moves opaque payloads. All
 * knowledge of the wire protocol stays in the cores; the frontend never
 * interprets a payload.
 *
 * Should be called in retro_init or retro_load_game. The returned function
 * pointers remain valid until retro_deinit, whether or not anything ever
 * attaches, so a core has exactly one code path and still runs standalone.
 *
 * During development this is flagged EXPERIMENTAL so as not to squat on plain
 * 94 should upstream assign it elsewhere. A core should probe the experimental
 * form first and fall back to the plain one, so a core built today keeps
 * working against a frontend that later adopts the unflagged number.

/* An attached port, as the frontend knows it.
 *
 * Handed back by attach and passed to every other call, the way a file handle
 * is by the VFS interface's open. The core never looks inside it.
 *
 * It names a PORT rather than a core, and that is what makes it necessary: a
 * machine with more than one socket -- a GameCube has four -- must say which
 * one it means on every call, so an argument of some kind was always going to
 * be here. Naming the port with a token the frontend issued, rather than a
 * bare number, lets the frontend validate it and tells it which core is
 * calling for free.
 *
 * That second part is worth having. libretro's function pointers carry no
 * userdata, so the usual way to recover the caller is a thread-local set when
 * the core's emulation thread starts, which holds only while a core does its
 * work on that one thread. Plenty do not: Dolphin runs its CPU on a thread of
 * its own whenever dual-core is enabled, and that is a user-facing setting. */

 * `protocol_id` names the emulated wire protocol, e.g. "gba-sio-1". Peers
 * whose ids differ are never connected to each other, which is what allows
 * two different cores emulating two different machines to share one cable
 * while keeping unrelated cores apart.
 *
 * `clock_rate` is the number of ticks of this core's link timeline that
 * elapse per second of emulated time (e.g. 16777216 for a Game Boy Advance),
 * so the frontend can convert exactly between participants' units. It must not
 * be zero.
 *
 * Returns a handle to pass to every other call on this port, or NULL if it
 * could not be attached. The core keeps it for as long as the port is attached
 * and hands it back unchanged; nothing about its contents is a core's business.
 *
 * The bus index a core needs for addressing comes from peers(), not from here,
 * because a cable can be plugged or pulled at any time and an index handed out
 * once would be stale by the next transfer. */

 * core is told about a transfer ahead of time precisely so it can schedule its
 * own side of it for that tick, so messages are handed over as soon as they
 * arrive rather than held until the clock catches up. What stops one landing in
 * the past is the sender's commit horizon: it promised not to originate before
 * that tick, and the bus will not have let this core run beyond it. */

/* Publish this core's position and its commit horizon, then ask how far it may
 * advance. Blocks until `request_tick` can be granted or until every peer has
 * detached.
 *
 * `local_tick` is where the core is now. `safe_tick` is a promise that the core
 * will not originate any event a peer must observe before that tick; it must be
 * greater than or equal to `local_tick` and, once published, may never be
 * retracted.
 *
 * The horizon is what keeps the bus deadlock-free, and it is required, not an
 * optimization. A core that always passes `safe_tick == local_tick` promises
 * nothing, so if every participant does that they all sit at the same tick
 * waiting for someone else to move and none of them ever can. Publishing a
 * horizon some way ahead of the current position lets peers run to it without
 * asking, and the core makes the promise true by scheduling anything it
 * originates at the horizon rather than at the instant the guest asked for it.
 *
 * The horizon is therefore a tuning knob, traded against fidelity: a larger one
 * means fewer rendezvous and more emulated delay before an originated event
 * lands. Within a single process it only has to be large enough to avoid
 * synchronizing every few cycles, so a small fraction of a frame is plenty.
 *
 * Returns the tick this core may advance to: `request_tick`, or more only
 * where a previous grant or the core's own position already stood further on.
 * The grant is never larger than what was asked for even when more headroom
 * happens to be available, because how far a peer has run at this instant is a
 * wall-clock accident and returning it would make two machines replaying
 * identical inputs disagree. Ask for more to get more.
 *
 * The result is always at least `local_tick`, never less than a previously
 * returned value, or RETRO_LINK_UNBOUNDED.
 *
 * The grant MUST be a pure function of the participants' published ticks. It
 * must never depend on wall-clock time, nor on the order in which threads
 * happen to arrive. A frontend that violates this will desync any peer that
 * replays the same inputs expecting the same result, which is exactly what
 * rollback and lockstep multiplayer do. For the same reason there is
 * deliberately no timeout: a peer that is behind is waited for, not guessed at.
 *
 * Thread-safe. Cores generally run on their own emulation threads, and this
 * call is the rendezvous between them. */
